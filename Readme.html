      <p>To play the game, download a interpter from <a href="https://truck.it/p/_HL5xCRhoD">HERE</a> and open the Batch file then the &quot;Grease Beta vx.x.py&quot; file. Once open, press F5 and begin! </p>
      <p>CTRL - Shoot </p>
      <p>WASD- Move</p>
      <p>You must kill as many people as you can.. to gain more points. At the first instance you will watch the move, this will give you a short background on what the game is about. shortly after.. you will be able to shoot incocent people. TO THE DEATH. </p>
      <p>Keep shooting and don't let your green bar (health bar) go down too much. I know, his wheelchair is very slow! Also, get those &quot;health balls&quot; they are balls of fried chicken. </p>
      <p>After this you will be greeted with a hallway, you are now to kill the boss!      </p>
      <p>To kill the boss.. just keep shooting as fast as you can, he has grenades coming out of his HEAD! and when it hits you, it hurts!</p>
      <p><font size="+2">Storyline</font></p>
      <p>Joe the main Character in this game, is a Bad eater  and has no sense of humour, not to mention his ruthless lack of hygiene. He  gets up from his deep sleep at about 12pm and it’s a beautiful day but he  doesn’t care, he just heads straight towards to the chicken shop which he goes  to every morning, he needs his chicken, his  chicken completes him. The start will be in a light atmosphere... where it is  all happy and dandy but as soon as the old fat man called “Joe” comes up and tries  to make his daily order which he usually has, a new girl is at the restaurant  and she says that he cannot be here to eat because he is too fat, he just about  sits in his scooter but it looks like the bars on the scooter can break at any  moment in time. He gets angry at her and says he is going to sort this out  because this is the company’s fault that he got this fat!</p>
      <p><br />
        The mission  is to kill the boss of the fried chicken restaurant, so you need to go to the  office but the police have been informed and you need to kill them with a very  deadly fried chicken... Machine GUN! When bob needs his chicken balls! he needs to  find some so he steals them from other people and runs them over because he  needs to get to his final destination. His health will go down quite vigorously  and you need to keep it at bay so you need to collect the chicken balls which will give you more health.   Once he gets the boss he has to kill the boss with the   machine gun....   he has a rocket launcher He is throwing his weight  around and he might get to close and eat you. If he eats you it’s the end but  if you do it just in time you win the game and bob feels human again. </p>
