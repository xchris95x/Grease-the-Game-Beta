<p>Joe the main Character in this game, is a Bad eater and has no sense of humour, not to mention his ruthless lack of hygiene. He gets up from his deep sleep at about 12pm and it’s a beautiful day but he doesn’t care, he just heads straight towards to the chicken shop which he goes to every morning, he needs his chicken, his chicken completes him. The start will be in a light atmosphere... where it is all happy and dandy but as soon as the old fat man called “Joe” comes up and tries to make his daily order which he usually has, a new girl is at the restaurant and she says that he cannot be here to eat because he is too fat, he just about sits in his scooter but it looks like the bars on the scooter can break at any moment in time. He gets angry at her and says he is going to sort this out because this is the company’s fault that he got this fat!</p>

<p>The mission is to kill the boss of the fried chicken restaurant, so you need to go to the office but the police have been informed and you need to kill them with a very deadly fried chicken... Machine GUN! When bob needs his chicken balls! he needs to find some so he steals them from other people and runs them over because he needs to get to his final destination. His health will go down quite vigorously and you need to keep it at bay so you need to collect the chicken balls which will give you more health.  Once he gets the boss he has to kill the boss with the machine gun.... he has a rocket launcher He is throwing his weight around and he might get to close and eat you. If he eats you it’s the end but if you do it just in time you win the game and bob feels human again.</p>
