I'm a 19 year old new Developer, what do you expect? I'm trying out all sorts of things. Right now I want to get this game as a Executable and then I will work on the code! I think I may turn it into a OOP game. Just ease of my back will you!\r\n\r\nJoe the main Character in this game, is a Bad eater and has no sense of humour, not to mention his ruthless lack of hygiene. He gets up from his deep sleep at about 12pm and it’s a beautiful day but he doesn’t care, he just heads straight towards to the chicken shop which he goes to every morning, he needs his chicken, his chicken completes him. The start will be in a light atmosphere... where it is all happy and dandy but as soon as the old fat man called “Joe” comes up and tries to make his daily order which he usually has, a new girl is at the restaurant and she says that he cannot be here to eat because he is too fat, he just about sits in his scooter but it looks like the bars on the scooter can break at any moment in time. He gets angry at her and says he is going to sort this out because this is the company’s fault that he got this fat!\r\n\r\n![Screenshot (actual size)](https://dl.dumptruck.goldenfrog.com/p/7159nObsu1/screenshot.PNG)\r\n\r\n# Support and Contact\r\n\r\n[Use our Tracking system](https://github.com/xchris95x/Grease-the-Game-Beta/issues)\r\n\r\n# License and Legal\r\n\r\n[This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International License.](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\r\n[Music by Jake Chudnow](https://soundcloud.com/jakechudnow)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
